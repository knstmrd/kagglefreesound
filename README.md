# Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge

Code for the [Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging).

Currently only code for running cross-validation stuff, feature processing and writing logs (so no classifier settings or feature extraction, the competition is still ongoing).
